What search engines value:
1.	Relevance - thematic and semantic relevance
2.	Authoritative - search engines verify the authority by seeing what other websites say about your content, via links, references, reviews, etc. 
 
SEO is all about more visitors finding you for the right reasons
 
Paid listings appear first as a result of businesses bidding on these keywords. Search results are also as a result of the code behind the pages fed to search engines via structured data 
The key to success is understanding the search engine goals
 
How SEO affects your business
 
•	When done well, SEO can help you reach a tremendously large audience, attract more visitors, and measure the impact of your methods (to determine your ROI on SEO). 
•	Intent is motivation behind a given search
 
Keywords: The Foundation of SEO
Choose the right keywords based on: 
•	Relevance
•	Search volume
•	Competitiveness
 
Relevance
Start by brain storming: what products do you sell?
Include keywords on what the customer is likely to search for. "ice cream shops near me"
 
Some examples of SEO expansion tools include: 
•	Google search console
•	Google trends
•	Answer the public
•	Moz Keyword 
•	Etc. 
 
Search Volume
Long tail keywords: not the most search volume from them, but are highly useful. Individually, there may not be a lot of search volumes on these terms but collectively, can represent a lot of great visitors. 
 
Analyzing SEO keywords and leveraging keyword attributes
The tools that will help you explore these keywords:
•	Moz Keyword explorer
•	Spyfu
•	Keywords everywhere
 
You can also use Google tends to compare how keywords are performing against each other over time. 
 
Assigning keywords to specific pages of your website
This is called keyword distribution.  It results in the content of your pages being aligned with the keywords you're targeting

1.	Place your pages on a spreadsheet according to your sitemap and hierarchy
Include a column for the keyword you’re targeting and optimization components.
2.	Next, match your pages to keywords. If you have a keyword that does not match any of your pages, create a new one. This will help you to identify where new content is needed. 
Moz On page grader will help you to get feedback on which parts of your pages you need to optimize. 

It is an ongoing process because keywords are constantly changing. 

 
The Process: 
 

Content optimization: How search engines and people view webpages
Constantly improving the quality and relevance of your content. Both people and search engines expect clarity and quality from your webpages. 

Optimizing site structure
As you will be exploring more keywords, you will likely be developing more pages. It is important to structure your site so that search engines know how your pages relate to each other. 
Search engines crawls through your website to find out what’s there and where this content can be found. 

This way, search engines can point new visitors to your website exactly where the content they are looking for can be found. 

The way you link your pages is important, this is known as internal linking. 
Therefore, you should develop a site structure that is logical and is easy to navigate through. 

On-page optimization
If you’re optimizing for a given keyword, start with the URL – reasonable length, but with the target keyword phrase. If you’re going to change the URL for SEO purposes, make sure you change all the links pointing to this page
Use hyphens to separate these words. 
Go to the source code and change your meta title tag (65 - char), meta description (not as effective as the meta title tag – 156 char), h1 
Be concise in all the above
Optimize for people first, search engines second!!!!!
Write like a human for a human. 
Include variations of the keyword
What about images? Rename the image source file, the same way you optimized your URL. Because the search engine won’t detect what is in the image. 
Change both  img-src “ ” and alt  texts

On the page, use descriptive texts to accompany media (images and videos). 
-	You can even add a complete transcript of the video

Technical SEO: Understanding the code behind webpages
To determine whether content is relevant or authoritative, search engines looks at the code sent from servers to the browser. Therefore, ensure you have clean, efficient, and error-free code. 
How do you make your new content discoverable?
a)	Link from within your site: menus, promotions, internal links, etc. 
b)	XML sitemaps – organized list that mirrors your site’s structure. – XML format of sitemap is directly fed to the search engines. If you want to learn how to create sitemaps, visit sitemaps.org 
c)	Set rules for your search engine to follow – robots.txt file >> for example if you don’t want some pages to show up (e.g. members only)
d)	To prevent a page from showing up completely use the “no index” meta tag
Best practices:
-	Use tools to monitor the uptime of your servers
-	Speed up page loading times
-	Secure your site with HTTPs protocol

Working with canonical URLs and redirects
Our pages can introduce slightly varied URLs pointing to the same page. 
To solve this, use the rel canonical meta tag – indicates that a given piece of content must be indexed by the main URL that the tag defines. 
You can also go to Google search console/bing web master tools and define the URL parameters that should be ignored. 

Alternatively, if you move content from one location to another duplicate content may be created. – Here use redirect rules
Types: 302 (temporary), 301 (permanent)
Avoid JS/Meta refresh redirects. – because they are not properly picked up by search engines. 

Leveraging structured data
Schema/structured data – the structure and attributes of all kinds of elements
Schema.org
Structured data gives you an opportunity to tell the search engine what exactly the content is, for example, a recipe, product review, etc. 
You can include information such as the owner of the recipe
Anytime you can specifically identify content for search engines, you should do it. 
Use JSON-LD

Using Google Search Console for SEO
What does it allow you to do?
-	Allows you to know which information search engines have about your website
-	See how your pages are performing in search results
-	Allow you to provide them with information on how to best  
Using the Google Page Experience signal and Core Web Vitals
Search engines are looking to understand your content when they crawl your pages. To do this, they take to account how human users perceive your website, especially performance and security-wise. 
Google has metrics called, core web vitals that help you measure and improve your websites performance and usability. 
Core web vitals: 
1.	Largest contentful paint
2.	First input delay
3.	Cumulative layout shift
Google generates separate reports based on:
-	Mobile and desktop devices. Within these there are 2 distinct reports based on field data and lab data. 
What you should know: 
-	Google uses the field data for ranking (every 28 days)
-	Lab data scores tend to be lower.
-	Field and lab data metrics are slightly different
-	Lab data report provides diagnostics and suggestions.

Planning content over long term
Content strategy: 
1.	Define business goals and key performance indicators. 
2.	Understand your audience
3.	Put a formal plan of when and how content will be created. 

Content creation and management
1.	Leverage different content types
2.	Keep up to date with trends
3.	Leverage relationships w/ a customer for example – to create a case study with
Execution
1.	Impeccable use of grammar, language, and spelling
2.	Your associates should maintain a healthy online prescence on behalf of the organization
3.	Promote content and measure your content performance

Link building and Measurement strategies
Links is one of the most important aspects of SEO. Search engines consider each link as a vote of confidence for the content that it is pointing to. But not all votes are equal because there are other websites (.gov, .edu) that are considered more authoritative and trustworthy. 

In SEO, this is what matters, as far as links are concerned: 
1.	The number of links pointing to you – link popularity
2.	The Quality of those links
So how do search engines determine the quality of these links?
1.	Is the content relevant? (thematic connection)
2.	They look at the link text (anchor text) 
3.	In line with timing and trends
Don’t try to trick the system
Consequences: dropping you from rankings and even dropping you from the entire index. 

Link Building
Internal linking can be classified into navigation links and contextual links (found in specific content in your page and link to other pages). How you link your pages in your site helps search engines understand your structure, the topics and themes of your content, and the relative importance of each of your pages. 
Building external links(broad topic)
Best practices
External link opportunities:
•	Directories – if it conducts an editorial or review process and only accepts relevant and trusted websites. For example local business directories – where you can submit and manage your information with the different search engines directly. Another example – industry specific groups
•	The best way to build external links is to entice other websites to link to your content. How? Great content naturally attracts. You can also share your content via newsletters, blog, social networks, etc. 
-	Reach out to others that target the same audience as yours

•	Analyze the backlinks of other sites that are already ranking well for a target keyword. 

Measuring SEO Performance
Measure to find out where your efforts are paying off and where you need improving
>> Remember SEO is a continuous process requiring a holistic approach 
MEASURE -> LEARN -> TAKE ACTION
You must have an analytics tool installed, such as Google Analytics, and configure its tracking for specific business goals. To configure it, you first need to identify your KPIs
A conversion (KPI) for you could be a customer:
-	Submitting a form

Apart from this, you also need to identify KPIs for SEO. For example organic traffic per a given period. 
Track how your target keywords are ranking over time (use moz). 
 Analyzing Keywords and Links
Use Google analytics, link w/ Google search console
Focus on keywords that are getting high impressions but low clicks. Make tweaks to see if it yield’s better results
Analyze backlinks using Moz link explorer
